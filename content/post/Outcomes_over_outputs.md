1. What is an outcome
    * An outcome is a change in human behavior that drives business results
    * Output = features, problem = features does not always deliver value
    * The outcome happens when you deliver the right features, ideally with as few features as possible
    * Program logic model: resources > activities > outputs > outcomes > impact
    * The good question: what is the customer behavior change that we are looking for? Example customer logging-in everyday to a trading web. An app could help but it could be a faster and easier solution like a daily newsletter with performance analysis for instance
2. Using outcomes
    * Finding the right outcome - the magic questions: 1) what are the users and business behavior that drives business results (outcome we want to create)? 2) how can we get people to do more of those behaviors (features to try)? 3) how do we know that we are right (how to test this)?
    * High level question - always ask What  user behaviors has this initiative created that are driving business results? How can we deliver this value sooner ?
    * OKR - think KRs as outcomes. Express your Kr as a measurable customer behavior 
    * Use outcomes to track progress, what behaviors lead to hit your target. Leading indicators can easily show you if you will miss or hit your goals

    * Roadmap helps organization to manage uncertainty
    * Better solution than a list of features: a outcome based roadmap, a list of questions and hypotheses: How might we â€¦ We believe that 
    * How to find outcomes ? Create customer journey map, list what are the behavior that creates higher revenue and how might we encourage them ? List blockers and boosters in the map
3. Outcomes for organization
    * Organizational change requires to take colleagues as customers, what are their goals ?
4. Impact mapping for identifying features
